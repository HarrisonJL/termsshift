"""
Mutation check: proves each safety property is actually pinned by a test.

tests/mutations.txt lists deliberate breakages of the contract - each one
removes or weakens exactly one safety property (exact-capture baseline,
quote grounding, the truncation rule, fail-closed fetches, the validator's
comparisons, ...).
For every mutation this script patches the contract, runs the full test
suite, and restores the original. A mutation the suite still passes is a
safety property no test protects; the script exits non-zero if any
survive.

Format of tests/mutations.txt: blocks separated by a line "===", each
    <name>
    ---
    <exact original text>
    ---
    <replacement text>

Usage (from the repo root):  python3 scripts/mutation_check.py
